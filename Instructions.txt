Advanced Tic Tac Toe: There are 9 small tic tac toe
boards within one large tic tac toe board. Just like 
regular tic tac toe, you get three in a row, column,
or diagonal and you claim the board. The goal of this
game is to claim three small tic tac toe boards that
will let you claim the large tic tac toe board. There's
a twist: after one player goes, the spot on the small 
board that they marked corresponds to a small board 
on the large tic tac toe. The second player can only
place a mark somewhere on that corresponding board.
This is represented by the board being yellow.
If a corresponding board has been claimed 
already, then this player can put a mark anywhere.
